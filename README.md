# NOTE: This is a new Work-In-Progress, will be updated frequently.
## What is this project?
This project is catered to provide as an introductionary basis for Quantitative finance and algrotithmic trading by providing and programming basic quantitative applications and implementations relating to financial markets and trading. This will follow order with Stephen Blyth's book, and potentially other resources later.

## What mathematics is involved/Prerequisite Knowledge
For now, I will not be going into the mathematics involved as this is assumed knowledge. Topics include: probabilities, stochastic processes, statistics, ODE's and PDE's and Financial mathematics.  I might include explanations of topics and mathematics later, but implementation of algorithmic trading, and financial analysis and modelling is the aim of this project.

## UPDATE:
Seems like this is turning into a library of sorts, providing financial and quantitative functions for financial programs; the only dependencies are std vectors, cmath, and iostream. I am not 100% where this is going to end up- this will probably become a large library for a future project.
